# üí´ About Me:
Implement a simple linear regression model in Python using a random set of 20 data points. The model should calculate the slope and intercept, which you will use to derive the final equation of the line. Finally, apply this equation to forecast the y-value for a hypothetical 21st data point.<br>Instructions:<br>Generate a random scatter plot of 20 data points with x and y values (you can use libraries like numpy or random to create these points).<br>Using Python, implement a linear regression model that fits a line to this data. You may use built-in libraries (such as scikit-learn's LinearRegression or write a function that calculates the slope and intercept manually using the least squares method).<br>Once you obtain the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the line, write the equation of the line.<br>Use this equation to predict the y-value for a new point where x = 21.<br>Plot the original scatter plot, the regression line, and the forecasted point on the graph.<br>Your code, showing the generation of data points, the calculation of slope and intercept, and the prediction for the 21st point. A short explanation of your code, describing each step of your implementation. A screenshot or image of your plot that includes: The original data points (scatter plot), The regression line, The forecasted point (x=21, predicted y-value). Calculate and report the R-squared (R¬≤) value of your regression line as a measure of the model's accuracy.
